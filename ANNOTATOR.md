### Interactive annotator

You can annotate segmentation mask using interactive annotator.

#### Prepare config file
```bash
cp config.yml.example config.yml
```
Specify directory with experiment using `BASE_DIR` parameter, set to `experiments/<your-experiment-name>`.

#### Run annotator
```bash
python3 main.py
```

The user interface will open, which will display a generated by GAN image and a number of buttons at the bottom.
To draw a mask hold the left mouse button and drag it over the area of interest.
Use the mouse wheel to increase or decrease the brush size.
By default, the mask is filled with an ignore label. Therefore, **it is necessary to draw both the positive mask and the negative mask.**  Hold down CTRL to switch to negative mode.

OK button - Add the current image with annotataion to the dataset (`experiments/<experiment-name>/data`) and go to the next image

SKIP button - Go to the next image without adding the current image to the dataset

RETRAIN button - Train the decoder using all annotated images, model is saved in `experiments/<experiment-name>/checkpoints`

GENERATE button - Generate synthetic dataset, images with annotations are saved in `experiments/<experiment-name>/generated`
